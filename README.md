# IFC819_project

This is an educational app designed for Android (and optionally Google Cardboard) that I'd like to keep expanding in the future and potentially use it as a support material when teaching Unity, C# or any other programming-related stuff.

These are the features included in the app:
 - A <ins>**quizz & runner game**</ins> where you have a time limit to answer a series of multiple choice questions.
   - The questions are divided into different categories (only two at the moment, but adding more is extremely easy).
   - Both the order of the questions and the order of the answers are chosen randomly each time the game is played.
   - After a question is answered, the runner part begins, where you can get extra points (the more right answers, the more points).

 - A <ins>**VR demo with a minigame**</ins> where you have to find several robots with your gaze. The VR mode can be activated and deactivated at will, so if you don't have Google Cardboard glasses (or similar), you can still play this demo normally.

 - An <ins>**FPS test**</ins> where you can set a maximum framerate and see how that affects the usability and feel of a game.

 - A <ins>**list of sensors**</ins> that are available in the device the app is running on (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc). In an educational context, this helps to know if a student can make an app using a specific sensor.
